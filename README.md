## Day 3 - Intermediate Linux Skills & Cybersecurity Basics
#🚀 Today's Focus:
1.Intermediate Linux Skills
2.Cybersecurity Concepts: Threat Actors and Attack Vectors

##🖥️ Commands Practiced:
➔ Linux File Permissions:
chmod — Change file permissions

chown — Change file ownership

chgrp — Change file group ownership

➔ User Management:
adduser — Create a new user

deluser — Delete a user

passwd — Set or change user password

su  — Switch user

whoami — Display current username

##🛡️ Cybersecurity Concepts Learned:
Threat Actors — Individuals or groups behind cyber attacks (e.g., Hackers, Nation-states, Insiders, Cyber crimimals, Hacktivist, cyber Terrorist etc)

Attack Vectors — Methods used to breach systems (e.g., Malware, Phishing, Exploiting vulnerabilities etc)

##🧠 Conclusion:
Understanding Linux permissions is essential to secure files and systems.
Proper user management helps prevent unauthorized access.
Recognizing common threat actors and attack vectors builds strong cyber defense awareness.

##📂 Practice Artifacts:
Test files for permission changes
User creation and switching exercises
Notes on threat actors and attack vectors
Test multiple usecases

📅 Day 4 - Linux Networking Commands and Network basics
Today’s Focus:
Network basics
Theory learned:
1. IP Address (IPv4 vs IPv6) - IP Address: Unique ID for a device on a network.

IPv4: 32-bit  – limited addresses.

IPv6: 128-bit – almost unlimited.

2. MAC Address - Hardware ID of a network interface .

3, Subnet Mask, Gateway, DNS
Subnet Mask: Defines local network range (e.g., 255.255.255.0).

Gateway: Router IP to access outside networks(Internet).

DNS: Converts domain names to IPs (e.g., google.com → 142.250.190.14).

4. DHCP & Auto IP Assignment
DHCP auto-assigns IP, Subnet, Gateway, and DNS.

Devices request an IP, and DHCP server responds with settings.

5. Check Network Info - ifconfig 

6. Manually Set IP
Windows/macOS/Linux: Network settings → set IP to “Manual” or “Static” → enter IP, Subnet, Gateway, DNS.



#Understanding and practicing essential Linux networking commands used by SOC analysts and cybersecurity professionals.

🔧 Commands Practiced:
ip a – Displays all IP addresses and interfaces.

ip route – Shows routing table.

hostname -I – Displays my system IP address.

ping google.com – Tests internet connectivity (Here i select Google).

traceroute google.com – Traces route to a domain.

nslookup google.com – Performs a basic DNS lookup.

dig google.com – Performs an advanced DNS query.

netstat -rn – Displays routing table and interface info.

ifconfig – Displays network interfaces (legacy tool).

🧠 What I Learned:
What is IP Address, MAC Address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, DNS, and DHCP

check device's network information

How to manually configure IP

How to view IP and routing details.

How to trace and test network connectivity.

How DNS works and how to inspect it with dig and nslookup.

How SOC analysts use these tools for incident response and diagnostics.
