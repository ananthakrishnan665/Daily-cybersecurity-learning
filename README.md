## Day 3 - Intermediate Linux Skills & Cybersecurity Basics
#🚀 Today's Focus:
1.Intermediate Linux Skills
2.Cybersecurity Concepts: Threat Actors and Attack Vectors

##🖥️ Commands Practiced:
➔ Linux File Permissions:
chmod — Change file permissions

chown — Change file ownership

chgrp — Change file group ownership

➔ User Management:
adduser — Create a new user

deluser — Delete a user

passwd — Set or change user password

su  — Switch user

whoami — Display current username

##🛡️ Cybersecurity Concepts Learned:
Threat Actors — Individuals or groups behind cyber attacks (e.g., Hackers, Nation-states, Insiders, Cyber crimimals, Hacktivist, cyber Terrorist etc)

Attack Vectors — Methods used to breach systems (e.g., Malware, Phishing, Exploiting vulnerabilities etc)

##🧠 Conclusion:
Understanding Linux permissions is essential to secure files and systems.
Proper user management helps prevent unauthorized access.
Recognizing common threat actors and attack vectors builds strong cyber defense awareness.
